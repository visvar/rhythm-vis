    <h3>What is this website?</h3>
    <p class="explanation">
        This website contains a collection of small apps for learning musical
        instruments. They are each tailored to specific musical skills and
        sometimes also specific kind of musical data or instrument.
    </p>

    <h3>App Menu (‚ò∞)</h3>
    <p class="explanation">
        The app menu lists all apps with a short description and icons that
        indicate the supported instruments. You can filter and sort apps by
        different aspects with the sidebar on the left. Apps that you never used
        before are grayed out.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools (üõ†Ô∏è)</h3>
    <p class="explanation">
        The tools page contains smaller, but sometimes helpful tools. For
        example, you can see which MIDI messages your instrument sends.
    </p>

    <h3>Settings (‚öôÔ∏è)</h3>
    <p class="explanation">
        Global settings that apply to multiple (but not all) apps.
